Adder, Copperhead snake, Kingsnake, Rattlesnake, Anaconda, Black mamba, Bushmaster, King cobra, Python -> Snake, Venomous snake
Anything sub 1k size (Cavy, Rabbit) -> Vermin; may up this to anything 2k and smaller
The rest is done.
I also considered:
Alpaca, Blue peafowl, Cavy, Guineafowl, Llama, Rabbit, Reindeer, Water buffalo, Yak -> No longer domestic
Since half of them will be vermin and the other half aren't exactly common domestics.
